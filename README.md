This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies with `npm i`, run the server with `npm run dev`.

You can find the `app/pages.tsx` file where the components are rendered.


I would visit the [documentation page](https://ui.aceternity.com/components/github-globe) to learn about all the props you can pass into the component.

I really recommend this UI library for anyone who is interested in front-end since all source code is avaialble right next to you, it's nice to learn how these libraries are created.
